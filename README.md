Name of My Projects : Select Your Dream 11.

Description :

  1.Research the Pitch and Conditions: Start by understanding the pitch report, weather conditions, and how they might affect play. For example, a spin-friendly pitch might favor spinners over fast bowlers.

  2. Study Player Form and Statistics: Check the recent performance of players, including their scores, wickets, strike rates, and economy rates, to understand whoâ€™s in good form. Consider including key all-rounders who can earn points with both bat and ball.

  3. Captain and Vice-Captain Choices: Choose players with a consistent record as your captain and vice-captain, as they earn double and 1.5x points, respectively. Top batsmen or reliable all-rounders often make excellent choices.
